                            <P>CNN) â€” It has been a tough slog for some air travelers here at the Christmas rush.
                                As of 2:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, more than 2,800 flights were canceled as Covid cases surge around the world. Of those, roughly 1,000 were within, into or out of the United States, according to FlightAware.
                                And that's just Tuesday. Citing the spike in Omicron variant cases, airlines have been canceling and delaying thousands of flights since Thursday, December 23.
                                What if you're one of the unlucky passengers? Here are some tips to help travelers navigate the system when flights are delayed or canceled:Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute," said Scott Keyes, the founder of Scott's Cheap Flights. "Save yourself the drive to the airport."
                                Keyes told CNN Travel in an interview on Monday that you should sign up for airlines' free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier's app.
                                You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That's also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up.
                                Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across country.</P>
